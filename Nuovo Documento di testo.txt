i'm generallu very optimistic about the future. I believe that gasoline will be gone by the yeas 2100. i think that's completely realistic. We ill use the sun and wind for electricity, and most cars will be eletric cars. A scientist at Sunlight Motors demonstrated an electric car that can go almost 250 kilometers between charges. Many people are buying electric cars now. I think that pollution will decrease a lot over the next 10 or 20 years. Life will be going in the future.
